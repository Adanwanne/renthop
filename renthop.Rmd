# Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Do as much data exploration as possible by visualization, summary statistics and perhaps a more sophisticated dimensionality reduction method such as PCA and/or MDS. 

```{r preliminary questions}
#' (1) How much time is a posting live for interest_level to be gauged? 1 week? Are they still live?
#Who knows? We can just assume they are still live. I do not think it will change our analysis or outcome.

#' (2) How many observations of each interest level are there?
table(train$interest_level)
#' 7.8% high (3839), 69.5% low (34284), 22.8% medium (11229)

#' (3) What is the distribution of price by interest level?
boxplot(price~interest_level, data=train) #eliminate outliers!
tapply(train$price, train$interest_level, summary)
#' mean prices: high = 2700.293, low=4176.599, medium=3158.767
#' So people are more interested the lower the price.

#' (4) How does price and interest_level relate to listing location?

#' (5) Does no photo translate to low interest?
table(train$interest_level[train$photos == 0])
#' Yes 91.4% of the time.

#' (6) How do number of photos relate to interest level?
boxplot(photos~interest_level, data=train)
# For all interest levels, the distribution of photos in the ad seems equal. So perhaps having photo be a binary variable is a better option?

#' What is the lat/long for listings by interest_level? Are there clusters of regions by interest_level?
aggregate
length(table(train$building_id))

ggplot(train, aes(longitude, latitude, color=interest_level)) + geom_point() + geom_jitter(width=1)

#' Are there certain undesirable managers?
head(table(train$manager_id)[order(table(train$manager_id), decreasing = T)])
manager_feels <- data.frame(table(train$manager_id, train$interest_level))
names(manager_feels) <- c('manager_id', 'interest_level', 'freq')
manager_feels <- manager_feels[manager_feels$freq != 0, ]
mean(manager_feels$freq)
#Mean frequency for a manager is 8.6. Consider managers who have frequencies of 9 or greater.
manager_feels <- manager_feels[manager_feels$freq >= 9, ]
table(as.character(manager_feels$manager_id)) #use melt now? want to see how many frequency for each interest_level by manager_id.

#' Are there more/less desirable buildings?
building_feels <- data.frame(table(train$building_id, train$interest_level))
names(building_feels) <- c('building_id', 'interest_level', 'freq')
building_feels <- building_feels[building_feels$freq != 0, ]
mean(building_feels$freq)
#Mean frequency for a manager is 4.4. Consider managers who have frequencies of 5 or greater.
building_feels <- building_feels[building_feels$freq >= 5, ]
#building id of 0 seems to be an input error?
table(as.character(manager_feels$manager_id))

#' What are typical features offered? By interest_level?
high_features <- read.csv('/Users/adaezeajoku/Desktop/STATS415/Project/high_features.csv')
medium_features <- read.csv('/Users/adaezeajoku/Desktop/STATS415/Project/medium_features.csv')
low_features <- read.csv('/Users/adaezeajoku/Desktop/STATS415/Project/low_features.csv')

#Hardwood Floors are the most frequent feature of high interest listings occurring 1986 times. Assuming the feature does not occur multiple times in the same listing that comprises, 51.7% of high interest listing.

#' Which streets are most common in listings?
streets <- table(train$display_address)
head(streets[order(streets, decreasing = T)])
#' Broadway, East 34th Street, Second Ave

#' Do no features translate to low interest?
table(train$interest_level[renthop.tr$features == '[]'])
#' Yes 65% of the time.

# Note: '[]' in R View of dataframe is misleading. It does that because entry is too long to display.
